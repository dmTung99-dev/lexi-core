# LexiCore — repo orientation

Personal Vietnamese-first language-learning app. Full feature list lives in `README.md` (kept current — trust it over anything below for "what features exist"). Detailed feature/architecture history lives in `docs/superpowers/specs/*.md` (one file per feature/initiative) and `.superpowers/sdd/progress.md`.

## Monorepo structure (as of 2026-08-11)

This is one GitHub repo hosting:

- **Flutter app** (mobile only) — repo root: `lib/`, `pubspec.yaml`, `android/`, `ios/`. The only client for the mobile app indefinitely. **Flutter Web was retired 2026-09-05** (`flutter build web` support / the top-level `web/` scaffold are gone) — the React app is now the only web client.
- **React web app** — `apps/web/` (Next.js, deployed on **Firebase App Hosting**, backend id `lexicore-web`). Config lives in `firebase.json`'s `"apphosting"` block (`backendId`/`rootDir`) plus `apps/web/apphosting.yaml` (Cloud Run `runConfig` + `env:` list — non-secret env vars like Firebase Web config are committed there directly). Not Vercel — considered, then dropped mid-spec-review once the backend's role shrank to thin proxies that Cloud Functions does natively (see spec §3.1 for the full reasoning/trade-off).
- **Backend functions** — `functions/` (Firebase CLI convention, Node.js/TypeScript), a sibling directory alongside `apps/web/`. Deployed with `firebase deploy --only functions` (manual CLI push — not git-triggered auto-deploy). Test locally first with the Firebase Local Emulator Suite (`firebase emulators:start`).
- **Region: `asia-southeast1`** (Singapore) for both App Hosting and every Cloud Function (`onCall({region: "asia-southeast1"}, handler)`) — not the Firebase default `us-central1`. Chosen for Vietnam latency (~30-50ms vs ~200-250ms RTT). Client and server must agree on region or `httpsCallable` silently targets the wrong endpoint — `apps/web/src/lib/firebase.ts`'s `getFunctions(app, "asia-southeast1")` call must stay in sync with every `onCall(...)` in `functions/src/`.

`apps/web/` is the Next.js app (its `node_modules`/`.next` are gitignored). There is no top-level `web/` any more — it was Flutter's web-platform scaffold, deleted at the cutover.

**Cutover DONE 2026-09-05:** the React app (Firebase App Hosting, backend `lexicore-web`) fully replaced Flutter Web. `firebase.json` no longer has a `hosting` block; classic Firebase Hosting is disabled (`lexi-core.web.app` no longer serves the app). History: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-11-react-web-redesign-design.md` §3.6.

## Theme (Flutter)

Flutter UI uses the **Bloom** design system, ported from `apps/web/src/styles/bloom.css`:

- **Tokens:** `lib/core/theme/bloom_tokens.dart` — `BloomColors` (a `ThemeExtension`, light + dark), `BloomRadii` (sm/md/lg/pill only), `BloomSpacing`, `BloomShadows`, `BloomGradients`. Read colors via `context.bloom`.
- **Widgets:** `lib/core/theme/bloom/` — `BloomScaffold`, `BloomAppBar`, `BloomCard`, `BloomPillButton`, `BloomChip`, `BloomBottomNav`, etc. Import the barrel `lib/core/theme/bloom/bloom.dart`. Prefer these over raw Material widgets on feature screens.
- **`AppTheme`** (`lib/core/theme/app_theme.dart`) keeps a Material `ThemeData` for low-level widgets (`Slider`, dialogs, `TextField` internals) but maps its `ColorScheme` onto Bloom tokens and attaches the `BloomColors` extension.
- Color values in `bloom_tokens.dart` are copied verbatim from `bloom.css`. If you change a Bloom color, change it in **both** files.
- Font: **Be Vietnam Pro**, bundled under `assets/fonts/` (family `BeVietnamPro`).
- Light/dark follows `UserSettingsState.themePreference` (Sáng/Tối/Hệ thống), stored locally in SharedPreferences (`theme_preference`), not synced. The picker lives in Cài đặt → Giao diện (`BloomSegmented`).
- Raw Material `SegmentedButton` / `Switch` / `RadioListTile` are retired app-wide — use `BloomSegmented` / `BloomSwitch`, and `showSingleSelectSheet` for single-choice pickers.

## Backend/data decisions (see the spec above for full reasoning)

- **Everything lives in Firebase/Google Cloud** — one platform, not split across Firebase + Vercel. Database, hosting, and the AI-proxy backend are all Firebase/GCP products in the same project.
- **Database stays Firebase** (Firestore + Auth) for both apps — Supabase was evaluated and deliberately deferred, not adopted.
- **Backend = Cloud Functions for Firebase (2nd gen)**, scope limited to AI-proxy endpoints only (LLM, TTS, STT) — not a general data proxy. Firestore/Auth happen client-side via the JS SDK, same trust model as Flutter Web, existing security rules unchanged.
- Every AI-proxy function is an **`onCall`** function, which auto-verifies the caller's Firebase ID token — stops strangers from burning Cloud Functions quota, not AI spend (they'd still need their own BYOK key for that).
- **LLM calls** stay **BYOK**: the user's own provider API key is never stored server-side or in the DB — sent per-call, used in-memory, never logged.
- **TTS/STT use self-hosted open-source models** (Piper for TTS, faster-whisper for STT — not a paid third-party API), packaged in a Docker container on **Google Cloud Run** (free tier, scale-to-zero), called by the Cloud Functions proxy via same-project IAM (no public ingress, no hand-rolled shared secret). A separate deployable unit from the Next.js app/functions.
- **Pronunciation TTS (dictionary/vocab-example audio) is cached as real audio files** in Firebase Storage (= Google Cloud Storage, same category as S3/Azure Blob), keyed by `sha256(text+lang+voice)`, **shared across all users** — the first lookup of a word generates the file, everyone after that hits the same cached file, Cloud Run isn't called again for it. Nghe (Listening) audio is never cached — it's freshly AI-generated per session and always calls Cloud Run live.

## Deploy gotchas (learned the hard way during React Web Plan 1)

- **Cloud Functions 2nd gen and Cloud Run both require the Blaze (pay-as-you-go) plan** — not available on the free Spark plan, even though usage stays within Blaze's free tier for a project this size. Upgrade at `https://console.firebase.google.com/project/lexi-core/usage/details` before the first `firebase deploy --only functions`.
- **New domains need adding to Firebase Auth's Authorized domains** (Console → Authentication → Settings → Authorized domains) or `signInWithPopup` silently opens and closes the OAuth popup with no visible error. Every new App Hosting domain (preview or production) needs this.
- **Firebase App Hosting's Console-based GitHub deploy has its own "App root directory" setting, separate from `firebase.json`'s `apphosting.rootDir`.** The CLI's `firebase init apphosting` sets the latter; connecting GitHub for auto-deploy through the Console (Settings → Deployment) does not inherit it and defaults to `/` — must be corrected to `apps/web` manually in the Console the first time.
- **The Cloud Run TTS/STT service (`services/tts-stt/`) is a separate deployable unit from `functions/`** — it's built/pushed as a Docker image and deployed with `gcloud run deploy`, not `firebase deploy`. After redeploying it, the Cloud Functions runtime service account needs `roles/run.invoker` re-granted only if the service was recreated (not needed for a plain image update to an existing service). `functions/.env`'s `TTS_STT_SERVICE_URL` must match the current Cloud Run service URL — Cloud Run URLs are stable across image updates but change if the service is deleted and recreated.
- **Whisper STT runs on its own Cloud Run service `stt`** (same image as `tts-stt`, deployed with `--concurrency=1 --cpu=2 --memory=2Gi --min-instances=0 --max-instances=5`). `transcribeAudio` reads `STT_SERVICE_URL` (falls back to `TTS_STT_SERVICE_URL`); `warmUpSpeech` pings both. Rebuilding the image means redeploying **both** services. The Cloud Functions runtime service account needs `roles/run.invoker` on `stt` too.
- **Whisper model is `small` (multilingual, int8, CPU; was `base`)**, pre-downloaded at image build time. When no `language` is sent (the web client never sends one), `services/tts-stt/app/stt.py` splits the audio into ≤25 s speech chunks with faster-whisper's VAD and detects each chunk's language **restricted to en/vi, biased to English** (`vi` only if p(vi) ≥ 0.6 and > p(en)); an explicit `language=en|vi` still forces a single pass. `small` is ~2-3x slower and heavier than `base`: keep `--cpu=2` (and ≥2Gi memory) on whichever service runs STT (`stt`; also `tts-stt` if `STT_SERVICE_URL` is unset).
- **STT accuracy (2026-10): `/transcribe` gained an optional `prompt` query param** (Whisper `initial_prompt`; the service also now runs with `vad_filter` and `condition_on_previous_text=False`), and the `transcribeAudio` callable accepts an optional `prompt` field. To get the improvement, redeploy **both** Cloud Run services built from the `tts-stt` image (`tts-stt` and `stt`) AND run `firebase deploy --only functions`. Version skew is harmless in every direction: `isTranscribeAudioRequest` ignores unknown fields (it only checks `audioBase64`/`language`/`prompt`), and FastAPI ignores unknown query params, so an old callable silently drops `prompt` and an old Cloud Run service silently ignores it — nothing errors, you just don't get the benefit. Recommended order anyway: Cloud Run services -> functions -> web app (App Hosting push), so the web app never sends a prompt that gets dropped. (The mic constraints change in `useRecorder` is web-only and needs no backend.)
- **The Firebase Storage bucket needs CORS configured for browser-based audio fetches, or Flutter Web fails silently with no sound.** `apps/web/`'s `PronunciationButton` plays cached pronunciation audio via a plain `new Audio(url).play()`, which browsers don't subject to CORS for basic playback — so this bug never showed up there. Flutter's `audioplayers` package (added 2026-08-30 for the Piper TTS migration) fetches the same `firebasestorage.googleapis.com` URL in a way the browser DOES CORS-check, so Flutter Web (not mobile — CORS is a browser-only concept) fails with `Access to audio ... has been blocked by CORS policy` and no audio plays, with no visible in-app error (matches the deliberate best-effort/silent-failure TTS error handling). Fixed once by applying `storage-cors.json` (repo root) to the bucket: `gcloud storage buckets update gs://lexi-core.firebasestorage.app --cors-file=storage-cors.json` (or `gsutil cors set storage-cors.json gs://lexi-core.firebasestorage.app` if `gsutil`'s bundled Python is available — it wasn't in this environment). Origin is `"*"` since these files are already effectively public (their download URL embeds its own access token, independent of Storage security rules) — re-apply this if the bucket is ever recreated.

## Workflow

Development follows the superpowers SDD flow: spec (`docs/superpowers/specs/`) → plan (`docs/superpowers/plans/`) → task-by-task subagent implementation → whole-branch review. When starting new feature work, invoke the `brainstorming` skill first, not straight to code.

## Deploy

- **Web app (Next.js):** push to the connected branch; Firebase App Hosting auto-deploys `apps/web/`. It serves from its own App Hosting URL (Firebase Console → App Hosting → backend `lexicore-web`). The old `lexi-core.web.app` (classic Firebase Hosting / Flutter Web) is disabled since the 2026-09-05 cutover.
- **Cloud Functions:** test locally with `firebase emulators:start`, then `firebase deploy --only functions` — manual CLI push, not auto-deployed on git push (unless a CI workflow is added later).
- **Mobile app:** `flutter build apk --release` / `flutter build appbundle --release` / `flutter build ipa`. No web build.
